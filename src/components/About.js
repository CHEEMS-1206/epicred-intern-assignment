          We aim to make student loans quick and hassle free for Indians many
          students especially in tier 2 and tier 3 cities are unaware of the
          fact that they can get an education loan without collateral and they
          need not visit any bank for that, We at Epicred not only make the
          entire process easy but also negotiate the best deal for students from
          the lender without charging them anything , We want to make sure that
          no student should give up hope on getting quality education due to
          financial limitation.
